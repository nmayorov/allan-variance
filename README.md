allan_variance
==============

Simple Python functions to compute Allan variance and estimate noise parameters from it. The application in mind was analysis of random noise in inertial sensors.

*Dependencies*: numpy, scipy and pandas.

*Examples*: see [this](https://github.com/nmayorov/allan-variance/blob/master/example.ipynb) notebook.
